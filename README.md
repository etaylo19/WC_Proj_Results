In 2016, the Construction Industry Research and Policy Center (CIRPC) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville was awarded a three-year contract by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to use State of Tennessee workers’ compensation claim data to aid in injury/illness surveillance and prevention.

The Tennessee Bureau of Workers’ Compensation (BWC) supplied CIRPC with claims data having dates of injury in 2014 through 2016.  The abbreviated data represented forty of sixty-eight fields from their International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions (IAIABC) Release 1 database. Over 300,000 First Report of Injury (FROI) records were received. The data fields included information on the cause and nature (type) of injury along with the affected body part, the initial treatment given, location of injury, etc. A short injury narrative accompanied many of the FROI records.

The FROI data were then linked with the state’s Unemployment Information data records to determine the primary industry group of the employer along with the number of employees in the claimant’s firm.  All data were masked to protect the identity of the claimant and the employer from the investigators.

The following items accompany this document:
1.	Utilization of Tennessee Workers’ Compensation Data for Injury Surveillance and Prevention 2014-2016 (Technical Report)
2.	An Analysis of Workplace Injury and Job Tenure in the Health Care and Social Assistance Sector Using Tennessee Workers' Compensation Claims from 2014-2016 (Sector Report)
3.	An Analysis of Workplace Injury and Job Tenure in the Transportation and Warehousing Sector Using Tennessee Workers' Compensation Claims from 2014-2016 (Sector Report)
4.	An Analysis of Workplace Injury and Job Tenure in the Manufacturing Sector Using Tennessee Workers' Compensation Claims from 2014-2016 (Sector Report)
5.	A dashboard to facilitate two-digit coding of claim narratives according to the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS) 

The accompanying reports and other items found herewith represent the analysis of the data and other efforts by CIRPC to add to the body of knowledge in occupational safety and health. Our hope is that stakeholders will use these resources in the effort to improve workplace safety and health.

We would like to thank Ms. Abbie Hudgens, Tennessee BWC Administrator, and her team for providing and fielding questions about the data. Special thanks to Dr. Martha Jones of Vanderbilt University for her patient and thorough efforts to guide and assist us these past three years. Her participation in this project has been of great help and has improved the quality of our work immensely.

We are funded by a collaborative agreement with the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Grant Number: 5U6-OH10896-03.
